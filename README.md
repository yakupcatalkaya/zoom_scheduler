1) Before opening the program, you should change the context of 'your_info.txt' file.                               
2) In the 'your_info.txt' file, there are 5 lines.                                                                  
3) For each line, you should write your information after deleting the corresponding line in the same order.        
4) For example, replace "bilkent mail" with "xx@xx.bilkent.edu.tr".                                                 
5) After replacement, save 'your_info.txt' file and then run the zoom.exe program.                                  
6) In the zoom.exe, you will see a prompt that asks you where the program get your information.                     
7) "file" means you ask program to take the information from 'your_info.txt' file.                                  
8) "typing" means you want to type your information by hand.                                                        
9) If you want to choose "typing", write "typing" and press enter.                                                  
10) Then, the program will ask you your srs id, srs password, mail address, mail password, and telephone number.   
11) After writing each to program, press enter.                                                                     
12) After the program gets your information either from file or from your typing, it will start automatically.      
13) Make sure that you have an active whatsapp web account in your web browser.
